# Rename Raw Images- Python Option

Renaming images is the first key step in this data processing pipeline. For our study, field camera traps in various watersheds at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest took one photo each day over a time span of several years. The original file names were a non-descriptive series of numbers, following this step, they will contain information about the watershed the photo was taken at as well as time-series image metadata.

These steps were designed to process files stored in a shared Google Drive by
running the script in *Google Colaboratory*. Before renaming images contained in a local directory, a few modifications to the script will need to be made; however, the same general principles will still apply. For instructions on running the script on files on your local computer rather than in Google Drive, see **Section 1.2**. 


## Google Drive Files

### Load Packages

Before each session, first run the top 3 lines – these lines of code install the *Tesseract Optical Character Recognition Engine*, which allows us to later use the `text_to_string` function and read the timestamp from each image. Subsequently, load all required packages/libraries.

```{python load-python-packages, eval = FALSE}
apt install tesseract-ocr
apt install libtesseract-dev
pip install pytesseract

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import re
import os
import shutil
from google.colab import drive
from glob import glob

```

### Mount Google Drive

```{python, eval = FALSE}
# This will connect to your Google Drive. It will ask you to allow access
drive.mount('/content/drive', force_remount=True)

```

When using Google Colaboratory, before performing any file operations, you must *mount* your personal Google Drive. Find the code chunk with the above code in Colab and run it to allow access.

Afterwards, make sure all file paths used in any functions are for your Google Drive specifically. To find a pathname, click the orange file icon on Google Colab’s sidebar, and then click content to navigate your Google Drive. Right-click and select copy path to copy the pathname (see below).

```{r image, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./imgs/contentdrive.png")
#Update file path if needed - all images in imgs folder

```


### Copying Files

This preliminary step is used when a backup or copy of the original data is needed. It will copy all files in the source directory not present in the target directory. 

This method uses shutil’s `copytree` function, which blanket copies all files within a specified directory. To handle issues caused by direct copying of files versus copying of subdirectories, these are copied separate from each other within the code. 

```{python copy-files-method, eval = FALSE}

if missing_files == source_file_list: # Will copy entire source folder into destination when no subfolders/files are shared between the two
  shutil.copytree(source, destination + '/' + directory_name, ignore = shutil.ignore_patterns('*.gdoc', '*.gsheet', '*.gslides')) #1

else:
    for folder in missing_files: # Will copy all missing files/subfolders not present in the destination
      new_dst = destination + '/' + folder
      if os.path.isfile(folder) == False: # Copies all subfolders/subdirectories
        shutil.copytree(source + '/' + folder, new_dst, ignore = shutil.ignore_patterns('*.gdoc', '*.gsheet', '*.gslides')) #1
        missing_files.remove(folder)
      else: # Copies files not contained within a subdirectory
        shutil.copy(source + '/' + folder, destination)
        missing_files.remove(folder) 
    print("These folders/files were not copied (ignore if list is empty): ")
    print(missing_files)
  
```

Copying **any** Google files, be it Google Docs, Slides, Sheets, Drawings, etc. must be done manually as these files are special and not able to be copied using shutil^[For more information, see the comments within the script and text blocks in the Jupyter Notebook.]. For any additional file extensions to avoid copying, specify them as arguments for `shutil.ignore_patterns`.

#### Main Method

Finally, to copy the files, simply call `copy_files` within the main method. This method takes 3 arguments – the file path for the source folder, the file path for the destination folder, and a folder name for the folder created if the source and destination directories share no files.  

```{python main-method, eval = FALSE}
args = ("/content/drive/MyDrive/Duke 2022-2023/Data+/2_Camera Trap photos/Stream Photos/On_Deck", "/content/drive/MyDrive/Duke 2022-2023/Data+/2_Camera Trap photos/COPY of data for script/On_Deck", "Newly_uploaded_data")
copy_files(*args)

```


### Renaming Files

The renaming files script takes advantage of the **Tesseract OCR Engine** to read
the time stamp on the image. This string is then parsed to generate time series information. There are many complementary methods in this script; for more information, see documentation within the script itself. 

Be sure to allocate time for the script to run, especially on folders containing
large amounts of image files^[If you are looking to reduce the script's runtime, one method is to remove the loop within `extract_timeStamp` which searches multiple times for the correct timestamp if it is not found initially. However, this will increase the number of files which failed to be renamed correctly.] 

The pixel parameters within `extract_timeStamp` are designed for the images taken by the Bushnell field cameras used in our study. They may need to be edited manually for other classes of images. Pixel coordinates are identified with a pair of integers [x,y] where x is the column number and y is the row number. On a pixel grid, the origin is at the top left of the image. Pixel row values go from top to bottom, whereas pixel column values go from left to right.


```{python extract-timestamp, eval = FALSE}

def extract_timeStamp(pic_address):
    '''
    Extract time Stamp from picture file.

    From the bottom right of each picture file, the time stamp is read as image using cv2. It is then converted to a string.
    text which is then checked for format and subsequently returned through match_date_format.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pic_address : full source address of current picture file.
    Returns
    -------
    match_date_format.group(0) : unaltered timeStamp from bottom of the photo as a string.
    '''
    # print(pic_address)

    img = cv2.imread(pic_address) #read as an image

    # check if the timestamp is the correct format
    date_pattern = "\d\d-\d\d-\d\d\d\d \d\d:\d\d:\d\d" # eg 12-12-2020 11:59:32

    loop = 1
    size_extension=0
    x,y,z = np.shape(img)
    x = (x//1000)*1000
    y = (y//1000)*1000
    # print(x,y,z)
    while loop>0:
      ts = img[2352 - size_extension:, 2000-size_extension:, :] #(change if sizing conventions change!)
      text = pytesseract.image_to_string(ts)
      match_date_format = re.search(date_pattern,text)
      if match_date_format:
        # found timestamp, return
        break
      ts_2 = img[x - size_extension:, x-size_extension:, :] #(change if sizing conventions change!)
      text_2= pytesseract.image_to_string(ts_2)
      match_date_format = re.search(date_pattern,text_2)
      if match_date_format:
        # found timestamp, return
        break
      size_extension+=100
      loop-=1

    if loop ==0:      
      # reached end of loop without finding correct timestamp
      print("Correct timestamp not found")

    else:
      return match_date_format.group(0)

```
  
As with before, make sure Google Drive is mounted, and all relevant packages/libraries are imported. Then, update the file paths^[It may be a good idea to remove or make a note of any non-image files within the folder, as these will throw errors.] and run the main method (below).
  
```{python main-method-rename-images, eval = FALSE}
from glob import glob

#collect all folder paths from newly uploaded data on folder
folder_list = glob("/content/drive/MyDrive/2_Camera Trap photos/COPY of data for script/Newly_uploaded_data/*/", recursive = True)
# collect all folder path from on deck folder
folder_list.extend(glob("/content/drive/MyDrive/2_Camera Trap photos/COPY of data for script/On_Deck/*/", recursive = True))
# extract folder_name 
folder_list = [f[:-1] for f in folder_list]
i = 0
file_df = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/2_Camera Trap photos/COPY of data for script/Testing destination/file_df.csv")

# for each folder rename and add them to the new destination - dst
for folder in folder_list:
  print(i,"/", len(folder_list))
  i+=1
  # destination to save labeled images
  dst = "/content/drive/MyDrive/2_Camera Trap photos/project_dir/labeled_image_files"
  save_as_zip = False

  #will unzip if necessary
  folder, unzipped = unzip_src(folder)

  # #create new destination folder
  fdr_name, fdr_dst = new_folder(folder, dst)

  if os.path.exists(fdr_dst):
    print("path already exists")
  else:
    print("new path")
    os.mkdir(fdr_dst)
  print(folder)
  print(fdr_name)
  print(fdr_dst)
  rename_images(folder, fdr_name, fdr_dst, file_df = file_df)
```

The script generates a pandas dataframe which contains the old filename,
new filename, folder name containing the image, as well as the image **status** (whether or not it was renamed successfully). This dataframe is then exported to a `.csv` file in a user-specified destination. See below for an example.

```{python csv-file, eval=FALSE}
file_df = pd.DataFrame(file_names_list, columns = ["old_name", "new_name","status", "note","old_folder"])
file_df.to_csv(dst+"/"+"file_df.csv")
file_df.head()
```

```{r include-dataframe-image, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./imgs/dataframe.png")
#Update file path if needed - all images in imgs folder

```


#### Manual Renames

While this script works for the vast majority of images, occasionally some images
will fail to rename correctly. For any files where the timestamp generated a file name which does not match a valid date, run the below chunk of code to identify them.

```{python identify-invalid-date, eval = FALSE}
# Load in created csv, returns file name and path if extracted timestamp is not in range

file_df = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/2_Camera Trap photos/project_dir/labeled_image_files/file_df.csv")
file_df = file_df[file_df["new_name"].notnull()]
for index, row in file_df.iterrows():
  #Check month range
  if int(row["new_name"][13:15]) > 12 or int(row["new_name"][13:15]) < 0:
    print(row["new_name"]+" Month not in range, check name in folder :"+row["old_folder"])
  #Check year range
  if int(row["new_name"][9:13]) > 2022 or int(row["new_name"][9:13]) < 2018:
    print(row["new_name"]+" Year not in range, check name in folder :"+row["old_folder"])
  #Check day range
  if int(row["new_name"][15:17]) > 31 or int(row["new_name"][15:17]) < 0:
    print(row["new_name"]+" Day not in range, check name in folder :"+row["old_folder"])
```

Another common occurrence is when the timestamp failed to generate altogether due
to `pytesseract.image_to_string` failing. This is sometimes unavoidable and requires manual renaming of the file. However, this should not be a frequent occurrence due to the built-in loop in `extract_timeStamp`.


## Local Files

This section covers how to run the `copy_files` method and `rename_script` script
on files contained in a local directory. This is **especially** relevant for users 
aiming to rename images that are not from Hubbard Brook experimental forest, and/or
do not meet the specifications of our script (i.e the timestamp is located at a
different position on the image).


### Load Packages

When using files on your local computer, first install `pytesseract` - documentation
and more information on how to do this is available [here](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/). Then, load all packages as needed.

```{python local-python-packages, eval = FALSE}

import pytesseract
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import re
import os
import shutil
from glob import glob

```


### Copying Files

The `shutil` and `os` libraries can be used in the same manner on a local machine
as in Google Drive. Therefore, no modifications are required to run the `copy_files` method on local files on your computer. Refer to the instructions above in section **1.1.3**. Ensure the path arguments in the main method map to directories stored in your local machine. 


### Renaming Files

The script for renaming files is designed with Hubbard Brook images in mind. The format for an image's new name is Hbwtr_*watershed number*_*date*_*time*.JPG.
The date and time elements are extracted from the image, whereas the watershed number
is part of the name of the source directory.

If you would like to follow a different naming convention, the below method must be
changed (`generate_picName`) to reflect that. For example, changing `new_name` to `"Watershed"ws_num +'_' + date + .'jpg'"` would output *Watershed9_12042020.jpg* for an image taken on December 4th, 2020 at Watershed no. 9. 

```{python change-name-format, eval=FALSE}
def generate_picName(fdr_name, tStamp):
  ws_num = fdr_name[1] #!!!this should be changed if src_elements[-2][1] will not be watershed number!!

  stamp_elements = re.split('[\n: -]', tStamp)
  date = stamp_elements[2] + stamp_elements[0] + stamp_elements[1]
  time = stamp_elements[3] + stamp_elements[4] + stamp_elements[5]

  new_name = "Hbwtr_w" + ws_num + '_' + date + '_' + time + '.JPG'
  return new_name


```


#### Changing Timestamp

The most complicated and error-prone step in the renaming process is extracting a timestamp. The way it is done in the current code is by starting with the pixel location of the timestamp, attempting to read the timestamp with `image_to_string`, and zooming out if the timestamp

```{python timestamp-loop, eval=FALSE}
    loop = 1
    size_extension=0
    x,y,z = np.shape(img)
    x = (x//1000)*1000
    y = (y//1000)*1000
    # print(x,y,z)
    while loop>0:
      ts = img[2352 - size_extension:, 2000-size_extension:, :] #(change if sizing conventions change!)
      text = pytesseract.image_to_string(ts)
      match_date_format = re.search(date_pattern,text)
      if match_date_format:
        # found timestamp, return
        break
      ts_2 = img[x - size_extension:, x-size_extension:, :] #(change if sizing conventions change!)
      text_2= pytesseract.image_to_string(ts_2)
      match_date_format = re.search(date_pattern,text_2)
      if match_date_format:
        # found timestamp, return
        break
      size_extension+=100
      loop-=1

    if loop ==0:      
      # reached end of loop without finding correct timestamp
      print("Correct timestamp not found")
```

Our script is only able to extract the timestamp if it is present within the image.
If the image you use does not contain any time-series data, we recommend removing the `extract_timeStamp` method and changing the file naming format to reflect that.

After these changes are made, the script should again function identically to
the one housed in Google Colab. Update the file path and run the main method to
rename your files.

The script will occasionally throw some unavoidable errors, such as the `image_to_string` method failing to extract a timestamp. To deal
with these fringe cases, see **section 1.1.4.1** (Manual Renames) above.
